### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Wins by Batting First vs. Batting Second
- Compares the number of matches won by batting first and second for the **top 5 teams**.
- Uses a **grouped bar chart** to represent the data.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Match Result Distribution
- Displays the count of different match results in a **table format**.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Top 10 Players with Most "Man of the Match" Awards
- Shows the top 10 players who won the most **Man of the Match (MOM) awards**.
